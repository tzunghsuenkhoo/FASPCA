# FASPCA (Functional Areal Spatial Principal Component Analysis)
FASPCA is a extension of sPCA developed by Jombart et al. (2008) in the framework of functional data analysis (FDA). <br />
FASPCA was developed by Alaa Ali Hassan (2021). <br />
Codes uploaded here is an implementation of FASPCA on 71 stock exchanges globally (Khoo et al., (2023)). <br />
The uploaded csv file comprises of daily closing prices from the 71 stock exchanges. The period is from June 2 2014 to May 30 2017. <br />
